# SQL NOTES 

- SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a programming language that is used to communicate with and manage databases.
- SQL is a standard language for manipulating data held in relational database management systems (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

- SQL consists of several components, each serving their own unique purpose in database communication:
  -  **Data Definition Language (DDL):** It lets you to create, alter, or delete databases and their related objects like tables, views, etc. Commands include CREATE, ALTER, DROP, and TRUNCATE.
  -  **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** It lets you manage data within database objects. These commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
  -  **Data Control Language (DCL):** It includes commands like GRANT and REVOKE, which primarily deal with rights, permissions and other control-level management tasks for the database system.

## Relational Database

- *Relational databases* are a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.
- Key features of RDBMS include:
  
  - Use of SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data
  - Support for ACID transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
  - Enforcement of data integrity through constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys)
  - Ability to establish relationships between tables, enabling complex queries and data retrieval
  - Scalability and support for multi-user environments
